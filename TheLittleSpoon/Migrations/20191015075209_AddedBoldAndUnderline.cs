<u><b>Ingredients:</b></u>

1) 2 ½ cups  warm water (600 mL)

2) 1 teaspoon  sugar

3) 2 teaspoons  active dry yeast

4) 7 cups  all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (875 g)

5) 6 tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing

6) 1 ½ teaspoons  kosher salt

7) ¼ cup  semolina flour (30 g)

8) 28 oz  canned whole tomatoes (795 g)




<u><b>Preparation:</b></u>

1) “Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.

2) In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.

3) Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.

4) Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.

5) Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.

6) Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.

7) Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.

8) Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.

9) Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.

10) Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.

11) Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.

12) Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.

13) Add any garnish of your preference.

2) In a large bowl, mix together the ricotta, 2 cups (200 G) of mozzarella, 1 cup (110 G) of Parmesan, eggs, parsley and 1 teaspoon salt. Set aside.

3) In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until translucent. Add the ground beef, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Stir in the garlic, Savory spice blend, and remaining 1½ teaspoons salt. Cook for 8 minutes, until the meat is no longer pink. Add 5 cups (1.3 Kilograms) of marinara sauce and stir to combine.

4) To assemble the lasagna, grease a 9 x 13-inch (22 x 33 cm) baking dish with nonstick spray. Spread the remaining cup of marinara sauce over the bottom of the dish. Lay 4 sheets of lasagna on top of the sauce. Spread 1½ cups (375 G) of the ricotta mixture on top of the noodles. Pour 1½ cups (395 G) of meat sauce on top of the cheese. Repeat with the remaining ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce. Loosely cover the baking dish with foil.

5) Bake for 40 minutes.

6) Increase the oven temperature to 500ºF (260˚C). Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle the remaining 1½ cups (150 G) mozzarella and ½ cup (55 G) Parmesan over the top.

Ingredients:

1) 15 oz garbanzo beans (425 g), 1 can, drained and rinsed

2) ½ teaspoon salt

3) ½ teaspoon ground cumin

4) 1 clove garlic, minced

5) 1 tablespoon lemon juice

6) 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

7) ¼ teaspoon sesame oil

2) Place all of the peeled beans in the bowl of a food processor, along with the salt, cumin, and garlic. Turn the processor on to break up the mixture.

3) With the food processor running, pour in the lemon juice, olive oil, sesame oil, and water, and let the processor run until the mixture is smooth.

Ingredients:

1) 30 oz  cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed (850 g)

2) 1 red onion, chopped

3) ¼ cup  fresh parsley (10 g)

4) 4 cloves garlic

5) 1 tablespoon  lemon juice

6) 2 teaspoons  cumin

7) 1 teaspoon  salt, plus more to taste

8) 1 teaspoon  black pepper

9) ½ teaspoon  red pepper flakes

10) 1 cup  bread crumbs (115 g)

11) oil, for frying




Preparation:

1) To the bowl of a 2-quart (2 liter) food processor, add the chickpeas, onion, parsley, garlic, lemon juice, and spices. Pulse the ingredients together until just incorporated and they form a wet paste. Be careful not to overblend.

2) Transfer the chickpea mixture to a large bowl and add the bread crumbs, mixing until just incorporated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours, or overnight.

3) Remove the chilled falafel mixture from the refrigerator and shape into 1-inch balls. The mixture should yield 18-20 balls.

4) In a large frying pan with high sides, heat about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil to 350˚F (180˚C). Fry the falafel balls in batches of 6 for 3 minutes, flipping halfway. Once they are golden brown and crispy, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt.

5) Serve the falafel as desired, either as a sandwich, salad topping, or over a bed of greens with a side of tahini sauce.
